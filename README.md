Four R scripts are available in this repository that each relate to my thesis. Each of these scripts are identifiable by their name. 

The first script shows the code used to conduct the Classification and Regression Tree analysis. 

The second script shows the code used to conduct the Multinomial Logistic Regression analysis, using the nominal 'game' as an example. 

The third script shows the code used to produce barplot visualisations for the situaiton type distributions of the variables 'word formation type', 
count/mass status, abstract/concrete status, and genre. This script uses 'word formation type' as an example. 

The last script shows the code used to conduct Fisher-Exact tests, post-hoc Fisher-Exact tests and Cramer's V tests, using 'word formation type' 
as an example.
